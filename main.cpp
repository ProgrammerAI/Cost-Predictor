/*
	Hey guys, it's me ProgrammerAI. My mom (check the bio on my profile) 
	prposed me to make a program that predicts the price of a 
	house in a period of time so here it is. It takes 10 inputs 
	from the user and finds the average rate of change. Then it 
	multiplies the rate of change and the last value. Afterwards, it 
	finds the rate of change again but this time, with the 1st 
	predicted value, and divides the 1st predicted value by the 
	second rate of change and gives you your value.

	Â© ProgrammerAI 2019.
	Made entirely by me.
